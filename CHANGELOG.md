## 2026-04-23

### Changed — Dashboard AccountCard + metrics
- **3 metric cards extracted out of AccountCard** into a dedicated row below it. AccountCard is now identity + `StatusPill` only
- **Metric set redefined** — Engagement removed; new set: `Total followers` (all-time) · `Followers gained` (period) · `Follow-back rate` (period). Each as its own component (`TotalFollowersMetric`, `FollowersGainedMetric`, `FollowBackRateMetric`) sharing a `MetricCard` primitive with: icon + label (top-left) + optional period suffix (top-right) + value + optional pill + sparkline
- **`TotalFollowersMetric` baseline anchor** — during trial, the value renders inline as `4,832 (4,739)` with a dotted-underlined parenthesized number that carries a hover tooltip "Followers at signup". Keeps the growth arc on one line without adding card height
- **`Sparkline` component** — `h-6 w-16 lg:w-20` green area chart using Recharts AreaChart; one instance per metric, gradient IDs are unique per instance to avoid SVG collisions
- **AccountCard identity row** — avatar gets a connection-state dot (green/blue/red); identity line carries `@handle` + `Advanced`/`Growth` pill + **blue `Trial` pill** when `user.isOnTrial`; full name below
- **`StatusPill` (live action)** inside AccountCard on right (desktop) / below identity on mobile — flat `bg-bg` chip with radar-ping dot, label ("Following @fitness.inspo"), click opens popover with stats + Pause/Resume. Inline-block intrinsic width on all breakpoints (no more mobile full-width stretch). Radar dot replaces the earlier staggered three-dot loader (status vs loading)
- **Plan pill gains `Trial` companion** — `@handle` row renders a second `Trial` pill (blue-tint) when on trial so users never conflate trial access with paid plan

### Changed — Growth chart
- **Bar chart rebuilt repeatedly; final state**: every day = one bar; 7 past (striped green) + 7 forecast (dashed-outlined green-tint) when on trial; `YAxis width={28}` + `margin.left: 0` so bars push to the card's left edge; `activeBar` outline on hover; `cursor={false}` on Tooltip
- **Rich `GrowthBarTooltip`** — date header + identity row (avatar + `@handle` + full name) + 3-stat strip (Total · Gained (highlighted green chip) · Follow-back rate) + "Daily growth" hero line. `connection` passed via Tooltip render-prop
- **Chart header**: `Follower Growth` + blue `Trial` pill (when `period === 'trial'`) + compact legend (Gained stripe swatch, Predicted dashed-outline swatch)
- **Summary strip** — 3 Growth-Settings-style filter pills (`Total: +N · Avg/day: ~N · Best: Apr 18 (+17)`). `bg-bg px-2 py-1 text-xs` matching the Growth Settings filter chips; no borders above or below; all 3 fit on one row on mobile (px-2 tight)
- **Trial markers in chart**:
  - Dashed blue `Trial ends` `ReferenceLine` at the last trial bar — matches the Today line's style
  - Dashed muted `Today` line at the most recent measured bar
  - When both coincide (user on last day), Today line is suppressed (Trial ends takes priority)
- **Forecast logic** — linear regression on last 14 days + warmup factor + floor/ceiling clamp (60%–180% of recent avg); predicted bars get per-day `runningTotal` + `followBackRate` for the tooltip
- **Chart + ActivityFeed layout**: 5fr / 3fr grid on desktop (chart wider than activity); stacked on mobile; chart card's internal YAxis tightened so bars fill the width

### Changed — Trial UX sweep
- **All trial surfaces swapped yellow → blue** — `TrialBanner`, chart header pill, in-chart `Trial ends` line, AccountCard `Trial` pill. Yellow is now reserved strictly for action-needed states (depleted target, low follow-back, setup state) per PRODUCT.md
- **`TrialBanner` (last-day only)** — blue gradient card with icon chip + "Your trial ends in X hours" + "Kicksta will charge $X for your [plan] automatically. Your automation keeps running — no action needed on your end." + `Manage plan` CTA. Non-collapsible, non-dismissible
- **`PeriodSwitcher` during trial** — collapses to a single non-clickable "Trial period" pill (instead of 3 disabled tabs) because all data while on trial is trial data; reverts to 3-preset tablist post-trial
- **`getWindowSlice(data, 'trial')`** returns `data.slice(-7)`; **`getPeriodLabel('trial')`** returns `'Trial period'`; **`filterByWindow(items, 'trial')`** cuts off at 7 days
- **`isTrialLastDay(user)`** uses same-calendar-day check (not timestamps) — timezone-safe
- **Trial-era bar filter** uses local date strings (fixed a silent off-by-one where the first trial day was dropped in non-UTC browsers)
- **`mockUser.trialEndsAt`** anchored to **today 11 PM local** at module import; `createdAt = trialEndsAt - 7 days`; so the banner + last-day treatment always fire fresh
- **`PLAN_CATALOG`** exported from `mockUser` (`{ growth: { name, price: 29 }, advanced: { name, price: 49 } }`) — feeds the banner's renewal copy

### Changed — PeriodSwitcher
- **Custom date picker removed entirely** (not needed for V1 mock)
- **Segmented-control restyle** — `bg-bg` container with raised `bg-surface` + `shadow-sm` selected tab for clear high-contrast selection (previously both greys barely differentiated)

### Changed — Growth+ banner
- **Copy softened** — "Unlock 3× faster follower growth with Growth+" → **"Add Growth+ for extra algorithmic reach"**. Calmer framing that doesn't imply the user's current organic growth is inadequate
- **Purple icon chip saturation** toned down to `bg-purple-base/90` on the chip (CTAs stay fully saturated)
- **Mobile layout reworked** — icon folds into the eyebrow row (small 28×28 chip) so the headline + benefits span the full card width instead of floating beside an empty column

### Changed — System status module
- **Extracted into `src/components/SystemStatus.jsx`** — exports `useStatusChecks`, `StatusChecksList`, `SystemStatusRow` (sidebar), `SystemStatusIconButton` (mobile). Previously lived inside Overview
- **Mounted in `DashboardLayout`** — sidebar row above Collapse (desktop), 40×40 icon button on mobile header left (replaces the temporary Signup flow dev link)
- **Growth+ marked as `informational`** — doesn't contribute to the failing-check count (no more yellow dot just because the user hasn't opted into Growth+). Renders in a neutral grey chip when not subscribed

### Changed — Other Overview
- **`ActivityFeed` capped at 5 items** both desktop + mobile for consistency
- **Top Targets sort reordered** — active → queued → paused → depleted, then by follow-back count desc (so the top-performer star lands on row 1 instead of row 2)

### Created
- **`AccountSwitcher`** in `DashboardLayout.jsx` — sidebar trigger (avatar + 12px connection-status dot + `@handle` + follower count + chevron) → 288px fixed-width dropdown that extends past the sidebar. Dropdown rows show plan pill beside the `@handle` and a red `AlertTriangle` + "Disconnected" alert on disconnected accounts. Includes "Add account" link → `/signup/connect-instagram`. Separator (`border-b`) between switcher and nav tabs
- **`src/mocks/accounts.js`** — 3 mock IG accounts with `{id, username, fullName, profilePic, followers, plan, connectionState}`; `alex.personal` deliberately `disconnected` to exercise the alert path. Exports `defaultActiveAccountId`
- **`src/mocks/systemStatus.js`** — 5 state variants (`following`, `unfollowing`, `analyzing`, `warming_up`, `setup`, `paused`), all with dynamic `startedAt`/`nextActionAt` so "in 2 min" / "3h ago" read fresh every load
- **`CONTEXT.md`** at project root — rolling session notes (current state of each section, deferred issues, preview infra)

### Removed
- Engagement metric + engagement sparkline data (no longer shown)
- `mockProjectedDaily`, `mockTotalFollowersGained`, `daysSince` (no longer referenced after metrics rework)
- Custom date-range picker from `PeriodSwitcher` and all associated state/plumbing
- 5-row "System status" panel from Overview page header (moved to sidebar)
- Old yellow-wash trial `ReferenceArea`, DOM-overlay bracket, and "Trial · Apr 15 – Apr 21 · 7 days" caption — replaced by the in-chart `Trial ends` dashed line

### Decisions
- **Blue = trial; yellow = action-needed** — codified across the dashboard. Yellow now strictly for depleted targets / low follow-back / setup state. Red stays for connection errors only
- **Trial is a self-contained scope** — during trial, PeriodSwitcher is locked to "Trial period", metrics/chart/feed scope to the 7-day trial window, trial baseline shown on Total followers. Post-trial the period switcher unlocks and metrics become period-relative
- **LIVE pill on ActivityFeed stays red** — the universal recording-indicator convention trumps the "red = connection errors" rule in this case (explicit user call)
- **Growth+ is informational on system status** — not a health signal; never triggers the yellow dot
- **Chart summary strip uses Growth-Settings filter-pill pattern** — chosen to reuse existing design-system vocabulary instead of inventing a bespoke treatment (user confirmed after reviewing 3 proposed options)
- **Trial end indicator is a dashed vertical line at the last trial bar** — matches Today line style; when they coincide, Today is suppressed (Trial-ends carries more meaning)
- **Account switcher state is local for V1** — switching doesn't yet propagate to AccountCard / chart / metrics. Needs a shared store (Zustand) as follow-up; deferred
- **Predicted bars on chart remain** despite PRODUCT.md's "no projected data" rule — user acknowledged the liability and deferred the fix. Flagged in CONTEXT.md
- **Cancel subscription / profile dropdown deferred** — known gap, bigger project

### Flagged for follow-up (see CONTEXT.md)
- Predicted bars violate PRODUCT.md rule #4
- No profile/account dropdown or cancel flow
- Account switcher not yet wired to global state (switching is UI-only)
- Active-account disconnection doesn't surface on the switcher trigger (only in dropdown)
- `PlanPill` sized differently between AccountCard + AccountSwitcher (no shared primitive)
- "Add account" routes to full signup flow — needs a lightweight add-another-account flow
- Status dots have no hover tooltip

### Created — Targets page (`/targets`)
- **Page composed from small focused files under `src/pages/targets/`**: `index.jsx` (shell + state wiring), `SlotsCard`, `FilterRow`, `TargetList`, `TargetRow`, `KebabMenu`, `RemoveTargetModal`, `AddTargetSheet`
- **`SlotsCard`** — single CTA host: label + `X / maxSlots` count + green progress bar + `Lock` icon trust line ("Kicksta follows within Instagram's safe daily limits.") + sole `+ Add target` button (48px, full-width mobile, right-aligned desktop). Max slots derived from `mockUser.plan` (10 Growth / 30 Advanced). All statuses count against slots
- **`FilterRow`** — segmented pills `All · Active · Queued · Paused · Depleted` with live counts inside each pill; selected pill = `bg-surface shadow-sm` inside a `bg-bg p-1` container. Mobile: pills scroll horizontally, sort collapses to `ArrowUpDown` icon button. Desktop: full row with `Sort: Priority ▾` dropdown (options: Priority / Follow-backs / Most recent / A–Z)
- **`TargetRow`** — 56px-min row: status dot (+ hover tooltip) · truncated name (depleted = line-through + muted) · top-performer yellow `Star` (highest follow-back active row only) · status pill (Active/Queued/Paused/Depleted, tinted per status; paused is neutral-grey) · follow-back count (`tabular-nums`) · 44×44 kebab. Entire row is a tap target; kebab is the visual affordance
- **`KebabMenu`** — status-aware action menu (bottom sheet mobile, centered desktop). Active → Pause + Remove · Paused → Resume + Remove · Queued/Depleted → Remove only. Row header names the target. Escape closes
- **`RemoveTargetModal`** — destructive-action confirmation. Action-name button ("Remove target", not "Confirm") per CLAUDE.md. "Keep it" secondary
- **`AddTargetSheet`** — single path for adding any target: bottom sheet on mobile, centered modal on desktop. Segmented `Account`/`Hashtag` toggle swaps `@`/`#` prefix + helper text + preview + suggestions visibility. Account mode: live preview card (resolves via `mockResolveAccount` with 300ms debounce) + 5 suggestion chips from `mockSuggestedTargets`. Duplicate detection blocks submit with a specific message; when the duplicate is paused, shows an inline `Resume it` shortcut that resumes the existing row and closes. Invalid format → inline red helper, never a toast
- **`useTargetsStore` (Zustand)** at `src/stores/useTargetsStore.js` — `{targets, filter, sort, setFilter, setSort, addTarget, pauseTarget, resumeTarget, removeTarget}`. Helpers `filterTargets(targets, filter)` + `sortTargets(targets, sort)` live alongside. Seeded from existing `mockTargets`; in-memory only (no persistence in V1)
- **New mocks**: `src/mocks/suggestedTargets.js` (5 account suggestions) · `src/mocks/resolveAccount.js` (async preview resolver, 200–400ms delay, 11 fixture usernames)
- **Spec + plan committed**: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-23-targets-page-design.md` · `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-23-targets-page.md`

### Decisions — Targets
- **Primary page job is add + manage** (monitoring is secondary). No per-row analytics, no detail-view drawer — kebab actions cover management; the Add sheet covers add. Can revisit when per-target stats are real
- **One CTA, one flow for adding a target** — the `+ Add target` button in the slots card is the sole entry; the empty-state block has no button of its own, the user's eye travels up to the single CTA
- **Row tap opens the kebab menu** (full row hit target) for mobile thumb ease; kebab icon is the visual affordance
- **All rows show a status pill** (including Active, green-tint) for row-to-row symmetry and scan consistency — not just the non-active states
- **Queued stays as its own filter pill** (not folded into Active) because a target can sit in the queue for a while and should be explicitly visible
- **All stored targets occupy a slot** (active + queued + paused + depleted) — users can remove to free a slot; depleted targets aren't auto-purged
- **Design-system vocabulary reused verbatim from Overview's `TargetsOverview`** — same dot colors, same status tooltips, same pill recipes, same depleted-wash + line-through treatment. Cross-page consistency confirmed in the preview
- **Edge-case states deferred to a future spec** — disconnected-IG treatment, at-cap variants (Growth upsell button swap + Advanced disable + bar-color change), approaching-cap upsell nudge, auto-pause-after-downgrade banner. Intentional scope cut to keep this launch focused on happy-path

### Flagged for follow-up — Targets
- Advanced-at-30 disable + inline message (`You've reached the 30-target limit. Remove one to add another.`)
- Growth-at-10 upsell button swap (`Upgrade for 20 more slots`)
- Approaching-cap soft nudge (`2 slots left — Advanced gives you 20 more`)
- Auto-pause-after-downgrade banner (names auto-paused targets + Upgrade CTA)
- Disconnected-IG page variant (disabled add button, reconnect banner)
- Success toast on pause/resume/add (not wired yet — actions apply silently for V1)
- Sort state / filter state not URL-persisted (component-local only)
- Store not persisted across reloads (in-memory, resets to mocks)

---

## 2026-04-16

### Changed
- **Overview — Growth chart rebuilt as stacked bar chart** (replaces Recharts `AreaChart`):
  - Diagonal-striped green bars (SVG `<pattern>` over `--color-green-base` + `--color-green-text`) for actual daily gain, with a soft `--color-green-tint` "headroom" cap so every bar column reaches the same top — progress-track visual per the user-provided reference image
  - Adaptive bundling via `Math.ceil(slice.length / 12)`: 7d stays daily (7 bars), 14d pairs into ~7 bars, 30d groups by 3 (~10 bars). Multi-day buckets label as `Apr 1–Apr 3`
  - Custom `GrowthBarTooltip` hides the headroom segment from display so users only ever see real `+N gained` values
  - "N total" sub-label next to the chart title surfaces the window total without hover
  - Dropped `mockProjectedDaily` import and `projectedData`/`isOnTrial` props — projection tail no longer applies on a bar chart
- **Overview — ActivityFeed got a live indicator:** pulsing red dot (`bg-red-base` + `animate-ping`) + uppercase "LIVE" red-text label next to the Activity heading; `aria-label="Live feed"` for SR users
- **Overview — Growth+ banner tightened:**
  - Removed the "Available" pill entirely (CTA is the state signal for non-subscribers); kept the green "Active" pill for subscribers
  - Reduced horizontal gap `lg:gap-6 → lg:gap-4`, icon-to-copy gap `lg:gap-4 → default`, headline top `mt-1 → mt-0.5`, benefits top `mt-1.5 → mt-1`
- **Overview — TargetsOverview renamed to "Top Targets":**
  - Row cap raised 5 → 7 so the card fills its column next to Growth Settings
  - Added 4 new mock targets in `src/mocks/targets.js`: `#glutenfree`, `@macro.melissa`, `#weightloss`, `@keto.kevin`
- **Overview — page-level spacing audit (per CLAUDE.md 4/8/12/16/24/32/48/64 scale):**
  - AccountCard metrics `lg:mt-5 lg:pt-5` (20px, off-scale) → `lg:mt-6 lg:pt-6` (24px)
  - Section gap before AccountCard: `mt-4 lg:mt-6` → plain `mt-6` (single rhythm at both breakpoints)
  - Chart row `mt-6` → `mt-4` so AccountCard → Chart → Banner → Targets all share the same 16px section gap

### Created
- `GrowthBarTooltip` component in `src/pages/overview/index.jsx` — dedicated Recharts tooltip for the new bar chart that filters out the synthetic "headroom" stack segment

### Removed
- `AreaChart` / `Area` imports and `mockProjectedDaily` import from Overview (replaced by `BarChart` / `Bar`)

### Decisions
- **Bar chart with striped fill + green-tint headroom cap** chosen over the prior area chart after reviewing the reference screenshot — bars read as discrete "days of growth" while the cap gives the chart a consistent silhouette on quiet days without faking data (headroom is hidden from the tooltip)
- **Day bundling target = 12 bars** so density stays readable regardless of window length; single-day buckets keep single-date labels, multi-day buckets use `M/D–M/D` ranges
- **Live dot on ActivityFeed is aesthetic-first; backed by mock-only data in V1** — flagged as an honesty risk in session feedback (see improvement suggestion #2)
- **"Top Targets" is sorted all-time by `followBackCount`** — does not respect the page's period switcher yet. Ambiguity flagged in session feedback (suggestion #3) as a follow-up.
- **Growth+ banner drops the "Available" pill** — the Upgrade CTA already carries the non-subscribed state; pill was redundant chrome

---

## 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **AccountCard (Overview) — second pass to hero-number layout (Option B):**
  - Stripped all tile chrome from the 3 metrics (no inner borders, `bg-bg` tiles, or icon-circle chips) — they are now bare hero numbers at `text-2xl/lg:text-3xl` semibold
  - Hairlines separate metrics: vertical in the 3-col grid on `sm:`+, horizontal between stacked rows on mobile
  - Each metric has a small inline lucide icon next to the label (no chrome circle) and a context pill to the right of the number: "13 days" / "~10/day" / tonal "Healthy" · "Average" · "Needs attention"
  - Identity row: removed "Connected" status pill (avatar dot + Active button already carry it); replaced with IG account's full name under the `@handle`
  - Status button: added `ChevronRight`, `shadow-sm`→`hover:shadow-md`, `active:scale-[0.98]` so it clearly reads as clickable
- **Overview mobile layout** — AccountCard redesigned for small screens:
  - Metrics display as stacked full-width rows (icon + label left, number + pill right) instead of squished 3-column grid
  - Identity row gets the full card width so long full names don't truncate
  - Active status button moved to a full-width footer below the metrics (desktop keeps it top-right in the identity row)
  - Consistent 24px vertical rhythm across identity → metrics → status footer; status button hits 44px touch-target minimum; mixed-size text ("Active" `text-sm` + "· System status" `text-xs`) wrapped in `items-baseline` span so baselines align
- **Overview header** — removed filler subtitle "Your growth at a glance"; added 👋 emoji to greeting; reduced size from `text-2xl/lg:text-3xl` to `text-lg/lg:text-xl` to better match dashboard hierarchy
- **TrialProgress** — now full-width on mobile with progress bar always visible (previously compact `sm:inline-flex` with hidden bar below `sm:`)
- **DashboardLayout** — added "Signup flow" dev entry point: Sparkles icon link in sidebar bottom section (desktop, purple tint) and in mobile header left slot (previously empty spacer); routes to `/signup/ig-preview`
- **vite.config.js** — set `server.allowedHosts: true` to accept any hostname for dev server

### Created
- `fullName` field on `mockInstagramConnected` and `mockInstagramNeverLoggedIn` (e.g., "Alex Johnson — Fitness & Nutrition Coach")

### Removed
- **StatCards grid** below the growth chart on Overview — was duplicate of the 3 AccountCard hero metrics
- `StatCard` component, `healthTone` variable, and derived stat vars (`weeklyTone`, `rateTone`, `targetTone`, `expectedWeekly`, `expectedTotal`, etc.) from Overview — no longer referenced
- `Award` icon and `mockTrialProjection` imports from Overview — no longer referenced
- Duplicated stat line in AccountCard (`+67 this week · 12% follow-back · 4,832 total` with dot separators)
- `formatNumber` helper from Overview (no longer referenced)
- `ChevronDown` import from Overview (no longer referenced)

### Decisions
- AccountCard is the single canonical home for the 3 headline metrics (Total gained, This week, Follow-back rate) — **supersedes** the earlier same-day decision to size them proportionally (`text-base/lg:text-lg`) inside tile cards and duplicate them in a StatCards grid below the chart
- Numbers are hero-sized — they are the dashboard's main signal and should visually dominate the card; tile chrome was suffocating them
- Color only carries meaning on the Follow-back rate pill (green / neutral / yellow); other metrics stay neutral so tone reads as signal rather than decoration
- Connection state uses a single indicator per surface (avatar dot + one status affordance) — "Connected" pill removed to avoid triple-signalling
- Mobile-only: Active status moved to a card footer — the avatar dot already communicates live state at the top, so the button becomes a "tap for diagnostics" footer. Desktop keeps top-right placement where horizontal space isn't constrained.
- Mobile uses stacked metric rows (not 3 squished columns) so numbers and pills have room to breathe; desktop 3-col grid is preserved since it has the space
- Connection state is the #1 trust element (per PRODUCT.md) — must be visible on mobile. Avatar dot provides mobile affordance.
- Status button (open system status popup) ≠ dropdown — uses `ChevronRight` to signal "opens detail view", not `ChevronDown`
- Signup flow entry is a dev aid (purple tint differentiates from core nav) — useful during V1 frontend build where signup is unreachable otherwise

## 2026-04-14

### Changed
- **SignupLayout header** — restructured to responsive grid: mobile (logo centered, back arrow left, logout right) + desktop (logo left, stepper centered, logout right)
- **Mobile stepper** — moved outside header as standalone element (no border-top, sits on bg)
- **Back button** — mobile: arrow in header left column; desktop: labeled text link below header ("← Plan Selection") showing destination step name
- **Default theme** — changed to light mode (removed system preference detection)
- **Heading spacing** — unified to `mb-4 lg:mb-6` and `mt-1.5 lg:mt-2` across all signup steps
- **Icon shapes** — unified all heading icons to `rounded-full`
- **Button gaps** — unified to `gap-4` (16px) for all stacked button/action groups
- **Code cleanup** — removed unused imports, fixed misplaced imports, moved render-time side effects to useEffect, extracted shared `formatPrice` and `formatNumber` to `src/lib/utils.js`

### Created
- **Overview page** (`/`) — full dashboard homepage with: status badge, trial progress bar, growth chart (Recharts), stats row (4 cards), weekly summary, Growth+ locked insights, targets overview with health recommendations, growth settings snapshot (read-only)

### Decisions
- Overview page layout optimized for free-to-paid conversion: chart first (emotional proof), trial progress as scorecard (not deadline), cumulative followers counter (loss aversion), unused features shown as "Not yet enabled" (uncaptured value)
- Notifications removed from Overview — belong in bell tray, not competing with conversion-critical content
- Growth+ insights shown as blurred/locked cards for non-subscribers (no fake data, no urgency)
- Desktop back navigation uses labeled link with destination name; mobile uses arrow-only in header
- Mobile stepper is not part of the header — sits independently below it

---

## 2026-04-09

### Created
- **LoadingOverlay component** (`src/components/LoadingOverlay.jsx`) — shared loading/success overlay used across signup flow (replaces 3 separate inline overlay implementations in Billing, TwoFactorCode, and FirstTarget)

### Changed
- **IgPreview** — added private account detection: lock icon beside username in search results and confirmation view, yellow warning banner recommending public profile; replaced "Not my account" button with "Search again"
- **PlanSelection** — added info icon tooltips for features that need explanation (Targeted growth engine, Like after follow, Welcome DM, Gender targeting, Close Friends adder); tap to expand inline description
- **Billing** — added card brand detection (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover) shown as label in card number field as user types; increased loading overlay delay from 2s to 3s; replaced inline overlay with shared LoadingOverlay component; wired up dirty form detection for back confirmation
- **TwoFactorSelect** — moved info banner above method cards and made it more prominent with border + icon + title; added "I can't access any of these methods" help link below method cards
- **TwoFactorCode** — replaced inline connection overlay with shared LoadingOverlay component
- **FirstTarget** — show "0/10 targets" count even before any targets are added (with helper text); added "Growth typically begins within 24–72 hours" timeline note; replaced inline overlay with shared LoadingOverlay component
- **GrowthPlus confirmation modal** — added payment method info ("Visa ending in 4242") to subtitle; added benefit summary list (3 items) in purple tint card
- **SignupLayout** — added `DirtyFormContext` + `useDirtyForm` hook for back navigation confirmation; shows "Leave this page?" modal (bottom sheet mobile, centered desktop) when navigating back with unsaved input
- **ConnectInstagram** — wired up dirty form detection (password field) for back confirmation

### Changed (cont.)
- **Billing card brand detection** — changed from text label to inline SVG card brand icons (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover) inside the card number field
- **TwoFactorSelect** — removed duplicate ShieldCheck icon from header (info banner already has it); merged "can't access" help link and "try different account" back link into one compact section to reduce bottom clutter
- **GrowthPlus confirmation modal** — reworded copy so price doesn't start the sentence; bolded card info ("**Visa ending in 4242**"); upgraded benefit summary from flat list to structured card with header, dividers, and descriptions per benefit
- **Back confirmation** — scoped exclusively to Billing screen (removed from ConnectInstagram); only triggers when card form fields have input

### Decisions
- All loading overlays now use a single shared component (`LoadingOverlay`) with `icon`, `title`, `subtitle`, `color`, and optional `success` props
- Back confirmation only available on billing page under condition that input fields have values
- Feature tooltips use inline expand pattern (not hover tooltips) for mobile compatibility
- Card brand detection uses IIN prefix matching (first 1–4 digits) with inline SVG icons

## 2026-04-08 (session 2 — continued)

### Changed
- **Stepper phases** — moved `first-target`, `growth-plus`, and `dashboard-entry` from "Connect" to "Finish" phase so Connect shows as checked once user reaches targets
- **ConnectInstagram subtitle** — added "We never post, message, or store your password in plain text" reassurance to the page subtitle (Option A)
- **PlanSelection subtitle** — added "We engage with users in your niche so they discover your profile" to explain how the service works
- **FirstTarget subtitle** — added "We'll engage with their followers so they discover your profile" to explain what targeting does

### Removed
- "And much more" desktop-only section from Growth+ page

---

## 2026-04-08 (session 2)

### Created
- **GrowthPlus step** (`/signup/growth-plus`) — optional Growth+ upsell page with purple premium branding, unified pricing + comparison card, "How Growth+ works" explainer section, social proof badges, daily price breakdown
- **Purple color tokens** — added `--color-purple-tint/base/text` to `index.css` for both light and dark mode

### Changed
- **Billing popup copy** — changed from "Preparing your dashboard" to "Setting up your account"
- **Billing plan card** — removed features list on mobile for compactness, re-added as desktop-only (`hidden lg:flex`)
- **FirstTarget placeholder** — shortened to "Search accounts or hashtags" to prevent mobile truncation
- **FirstTarget suggestions** — reordered with shorter names first; replaced `#healthylifestyle` with `#gymlife`
- **SignupLayout back button** — hidden on `/signup/connect-instagram`, `/signup/first-target`, and `/signup/growth-plus`
- **Temp back button** — added small red test button next to stepper (to be removed before production)
- **Dark mode sync** — added `prefers-color-scheme` media query listener in `useThemeStore` to sync with system preference changes
- **ConnectInstagram restructure** — grouped password + server location into single card with divider; server location collapsed behind clickable disclosure ("Change server location"); removed "Selected" badge from account card; moved "Forgot password?" inline with label; removed "100K+ creators" badge; trust badges (SSL + GDPR) moved to bottom; carousel constrained to `max-w-md`
- **ConnectInstagram server location** — added `SERVER_LOCATIONS` array with flag emojis and recommended field; native `<select>` with flags in options
- **GrowthPlus layout** — multiple iterations: merged pricing card into comparison table header as unified card; desktop two-column grid (`lg:grid-cols-2`) with left column (header + how-it-works + CTAs) and right column (card); desktop CTAs span both columns centered side-by-side; card top aligned with heading via `lg:mt-16` offset; mobile stacks naturally with full-width buttons

### Removed
- Stats cards (500+, 3.2x, 28K+) from Growth+ page — replaced by comparison table
- "Based on accounts active for 30+ days" text from Growth+ page
- "And much more" desktop-only section from Growth+ page — deemed unnecessary bloat
- "100K+ creators" social proof badge from ConnectInstagram

### Decisions
- Growth+ page uses purple color system (`purple-tint/base/text`) to differentiate from core product
- "Continue to dashboard" replaces "Skip for now" — forward-progress framing, no guilt-trip
- Growth+ is clearly labeled as a separate add-on billed independently from the trial
- Desktop CTAs use `lg:max-w-2xl` to match content width above
- Server location on ConnectInstagram uses collapsed disclosure pattern to reduce visual clutter

## 2026-04-08

### Created
- **IgPreview step** (`/signup/ig-preview`) — debounced username search, result dropdown with keyboard nav, profile confirmation view with stats grid
- **PlanSelection step** (`/signup/plan-selection`) — Growth vs Advanced plan cards, monthly/quarterly/yearly billing toggle with savings badges, animated price updates
- **Billing step** (`/signup/billing`) — card form with inline validation, Apple Pay + Google Pay express options, order summary with plan + account recap, "Preparing your dashboard" popup overlay after payment submission
- **ConnectInstagram step** (`/signup/connect-instagram`) — selected account card, password input with show/hide toggle, "Forgot password?" link to Instagram reset, security reassurance carousel (3 slides, auto-rotates every 5s, manual dot navigation), trust badges (256-bit SSL, GDPR compliant, 100K+ creators)
- **`mocks/plans.js`** — Growth and Advanced plan definitions with pricing tiers and feature lists
- **SignupLayout stepper** — step pill with numbered/checked indicators, bundled visual steps (Account → Plan → Connect → Finish), back navigation

### Changed
- **Preparing popup** triggers after billing submission (not after IG account confirmation) — shows animated spinner + bouncing dots for ~1.5s before navigating to Connect Instagram
- **ConnectInstagram security section** — replaced accordion with auto-rotating carousel using CSS grid stack for consistent slide heights
- **`fadeIn` keyframe** added to `index.css` for overlay animations

### Removed
- "Having trouble logging in? Reset via email · Reset via SMS" links from ConnectInstagram page

### Decisions
- Preparing dashboard popup is non-interactive (no buttons), purely informational with looping animation
- Security carousel uses grid-stack layout so all slides share the tallest slide's height — no layout shift
- Trust badges are always visible on-screen (placed between CTA and carousel), not hidden behind an expandable section

### Changed (cont.)
- **Billing popup copy** — changed from "Preparing your dashboard" to "Setting up your account" with updated subtitle
- **FirstTarget search placeholder** — shortened to "Search accounts or hashtags" to prevent truncation on mobile
- **FirstTarget suggestions** — reordered so first row fits 3 pills (`yoga.daily`, `blogilates`, `gymlife`); replaced `#healthylifestyle` with `#gymlife` for shorter label
- **SignupLayout back button** — header back arrow now hidden on `/signup/connect-instagram` and `/signup/first-target` (point of no return after payment and after connecting)
- **Temp test back button** — added small red back icon next to step navigation pill, always visible on all steps (for dev/testing only, to be removed before production)

### Created
- **TwoFactorSelect step** (`/signup/two-factor`) — 2FA method selection with 3 tappable cards (SMS, Auth app, WhatsApp), info banner explaining this is Instagram's security step, back option to try a different account
- **TwoFactorCode step** (`/signup/two-factor/:method`) — 6-digit code entry with per-method config, auto-advance on digit input, paste support across inputs, auto-submit when all digits filled, resend button for SMS/WhatsApp (not auth app)
- **Connected confirmation overlay** — post-2FA multi-phase transition: verified inline → connecting spinner overlay (1.6s) → connected confirmation with green checkmark (~2s) → navigate to first-target
- **FirstTarget step** (`/signup/first-target`) — multi-select target picker (up to 10), suggestion pills that wrap 2+ per row, "Selected targets" section with green pills and X remove buttons, debounced search with result list, dynamic CTA ("Add at least one target" → "Add N targets and continue"), 5-tip auto-rotating carousel (same grid-stack pattern as ConnectInstagram), preparing overlay on continue

### Changed
- **SignupLayout** — SIGNUP_STEPS array updated with all 2FA routes (`two-factor/sms`, `two-factor/auth_app`, `two-factor/whatsapp`); DISPLAYED_STEPS Connect group expanded to include 2FA and first-target routes
- **App.jsx** — added routes for TwoFactorSelect, TwoFactorCode (`:method` param), and FirstTarget

### Decisions
- 2FA code inputs are individual `<input>` elements (not a single field) for better UX with auto-advance and paste handling
- Connected confirmation displays for ~2 seconds so the user can read the message before auto-navigating
- FirstTarget uses compact pills for suggestions (not full-width cards) to fit more options on screen
- Selected targets section stays visible during search so the user always sees what they've picked
- Tips carousel reuses the same grid-stack pattern from ConnectInstagram for consistent slide heights

## 2026-04-06

### Created
- **CLAUDE.md** — technical reference file (tech stack, design system, routes, mock data, component rules)
- **PRODUCT.md** — product context file (user problems, features, flows, brand voice, trust signals)
- **CHANGELOG.md** — this file

### Tech Stack Decisions
- React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui primitives
- Zustand for UI state, React Query prepped with mock resolvers for V1
- React Router v6 with named signup routes
- Recharts for charts
- Lucide React for icons
- Plus Jakarta Sans (400/500/600)
- Light + Dark mode via CSS variables, `.dark` on `<html>`, persisted in localStorage (`kicksta-theme`), managed by Zustand `useThemeStore`, defaults to system preference

### Design Decisions
- Four-color token system (green/blue/red/yellow) with 3 tones each (tint/base/text)
- No radio buttons anywhere — elevated cards or segmented controls only
- Bottom sheet on mobile, centered modal on desktop
- Mobile-first Tailwind strategy, 3 breakpoints (default/md/lg)

### Product Decisions
- Story viewing feature **removed** — does not exist in the product
- Warmup period is **up to 72 hours (max)** — badge text: "growth starts within 72 hours"
- **Never Logged In** and **Disconnected** are distinct UI states: Never Logged In → onboarding setup prompt. Disconnected → reconnect banner with safety reassurance. They do not share the same UI.
- Cancellation flow is a **6-step modal sequence** triggered from the Account page — not a separate route. Closing before Step 6 aborts with no partial state saved.
- Growth+ is **never pre-selected**, bills immediately on opt-in, auto-cancels with core subscription
- Like after follow is available on **both plans** (Growth and Advanced)
- Logo SVGs are **scalable** — no fixed dimensions, size to fit context

### Mock Data
- User (default + Growth+ subscriber variant)
- Instagram (4 connection state variants: connected, warming_up, disconnected, never_logged_in)
- Growth daily (30-day shape) + weekly summary
- Targets (4 entries: active account, active hashtag, depleted, paused)
- Notifications (4 entries: 2 system, 2 growth)
- Growth config (mode, filters, engagement toggles, welcome DM template)
- Whitelist (2 entries) + Blacklist (3 entries)

### Routes
- Dashboard: `/` · `/targets` · `/growth` · `/account`
- Signup: `/signup/ig-preview` through `/signup/dashboard-entry` (7 routes — Step 1 handled on website)

### Assets
- `kicksta-full-logo.svg` — wordmark + icon, for signup header and desktop nav
- `kicksta-logo.svg` — icon only, for mobile nav and compact contexts

### Project Scaffolding
- Vite + React initialized with Tailwind CSS v4, all design token CSS variables, `@` path alias
- Node.js v22.15.0 installed locally (`~/.local/nodejs/`)
- Dashboard layout: sidebar (desktop `lg:`) + bottom tab bar (mobile) + top bar with avatar
- Signup layout: standalone shell with centered logo header, no dashboard nav
- All 8 mock data files created in `src/mocks/`
- Zustand stores: `useThemeStore`, `useAuthStore`
- `cn()` utility (`clsx` + `tailwind-merge`) in `src/lib/utils.js`
- Mock avatar SVG at `public/mock-avatar.svg`

### Changed
- **Signup Step 1 removed** — account creation handled on the marketing website, not the dashboard app
- **Signup flow** is inside the dashboard app but renders without dashboard navigation
- `/signup/account-creation` route removed from CLAUDE.md and PRODUCT.md

### Design Feedback
- Input fields with icons need more left padding (`pl-11` or `pl-12`) to avoid icon/text overlap
- Signup form vertical spacing was too tight — increase gaps between field groups
- Signup form should be vertically centered on the page, not top-aligned

### Added to CLAUDE.md
- **Changelog Workflow** section — 5 rules for maintaining CHANGELOG.md
